### Pint of Science 
The [Pint of Science Festival](https://pintofscience.com/) is an international yearly event aimed at bridging the gap between the scientists and the public. Researchers come talk about their research in lay-man terms in a bar/cafe/public area to meet a larger audience. 
I have been part for two years of the [Nijmegen committee](https://www.pintofscience.nl/nijmegen). Last year, we organised two events around "Interpreting brightness and space" and "Stimulating the technological revolution". 

### Brain Olympiad
The [International Brain Bee](https://www.thebrainbee.org/) promotes student engagement with neuroscience through the organization of the Brain Olympiad. This is a competition aims at highschool students to learn more about neuroscience. 
The qualification for the Netherlands representant takes place in Nijmegen and Amsterdam.

### Communication committee Flux Society
Since 2022, I am part of the [Flux](https://fluxsociety.org/) communication committee in the social media team. 

### Fresco/Cognivence
During my master and my first year of PhD, I was heavily invested as a treasurer and then vice president in the two French associations [Cognivence](https://cognivence.scicog.fr/) and [Fresco](https://federationfresco.fr/). A few highlights among all the projects we organized:  

* Cognitive Science Forum project: I was in charge of creating and organizing 6 forums in cognitive science in 6 different cities in collaboration with local associations. These events allowed researchers, students, companies and the public to meet and learn more about specific topics in cognitive science. Every events were different to highlight the specific ecosystem of each city but all events were punctuated by talks, stands of labs, associations and companies, and alumni roundtable.  
* Creating an [alumni directory](https://federationfresco.fr/cogalumni/registre-cogalumni/) in cognitive science and a job ad page on the website
* Promoting and organizing interaction and collaborative projects between the different associations in the federation. My favourite being this [collaborative escape game](https://www.cjoint.com/doc/21_04/KDlrJpM7yBJ_Je-ne-suis-pas-un-robot---Instructions.pdf?fbclid=IwAR39Ym5BTLvoU2644u0cXZRQNDlBSxTdNOrgi73Jh7gMZRRLJRc6Xz97tP8) that we created for the Brain Awareness Week (only available in French).

# My project on collaboration: PhD et al.

From my struggle understanding how to create collaboration as an early career researcher, I created [PhD et al.](https://phd-et-al.org/)  
The aim of PhD et al. is to create a space to facilitate collaboration between PhD students around the world. The output would be a website that would have three main features:

* an online form to upload your project on the website and find collaborators  
* a repository of all the projects uploaded and the possibility to apply for collaboration to any project  
* a PhD directory with the profiles of every PhDs that upload a project or that apply to collaborate
